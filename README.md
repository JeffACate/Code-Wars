####  Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/YoureASquare.cs">You're A Square</a>

|   Heading    |   Details  |
| -----------  | ---------- |
| Difficulty   | 7 kyu |
| Instructions | Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

    In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages. |
| Examples     | -1 => false <br/> 0 => true <br/> 3 => false <br/> 4 => true <br/> 25 => true <br/> 26 => false <br/> |

####  Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/SplitStringIntoPair.cs">Split Strings</a>

|   Heading    |   Details  |
| -----------  | ---------- |
| Difficulty   | 6 kyu |
| Instructions | Complete the solution so that it splits the string into pairs of two characters. If the string contains an odd number of characters then it should replace the missing second character of the final pair with an underscore ('_'). |
| Examples     | "abc" => ["ab", "c_"] <br/> "abcdef" => ["ab", "cd", "ef"] <br/> |

####  Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/ListFiltering.cs">List Filtering</a>
|   Heading    |   Details  |
| -----------  | ---------- |
| Difficulty   | 7 kyu |
| Instructions | In this kata you will create a function that takes a list of non-negative integers and strings and returns a new list with the strings filtered out. |
| Examples     | {1, 2, "a", "b"} => {1, 2}<br/> {1, 2, "a", "b", 0, 15} => {1, 2, 0, 15}<br/> {1, 2, "a", "b", "aasf", "1", "123", 231} => {1, 2, 231}<br />  |

####  Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/TribonacciSequence.cs">Triboonacci Sequence</a>
|   Heading    |   Details  |
| -----------  | ---------- |
| Difficulty   | 6 kyu |
| Instructions | Well met with Fibonacci bigger brother, AKA Tribonacci. As the name may already reveal, it works basically like a Fibonacci, but summing the last 3 (instead of 2) numbers of the sequence to generate the next. |
| Examples     | [1, 1, 1] => [1, 1 ,1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 31, ...]<br/> |
| Notes        | [0, 0, 1] => [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, ...] |

####  Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/FindIntAppearingOddTimes.cs">Find the odd int</a>
|   Heading    |   Details  |
| -----------  | ---------- |
| Difficulty   | 6 kyu |
| Instructions | Given an array, find the integer that appears an odd number of times. |
| Examples     | [20,1,-1,2,-2,3,3,5,5,1,2,4,20,4,-1,-2,5] => 5 |
| Notes        | There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times. |

#### Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/DuplicateEncoder.cs"> DuplicateEncoder </a>
|     Heading      |   Details  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|   Difficulty  | 6 kyu | 
| Instructions  | The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate. |
| Examples | "din"=>"(((" <br /> "recede"=>"()()()"<br /> "Success"=>")())())"<br /> "(( @"=>"))((" |
|  Notes | Assertion messages may be unclear about what they display in some languages. If you read "...It Should encode XXX", the "XXX" is the expected result, not the input! |

#### Name: <a href="https://github.com/JeffACate/Code-Wars/blob/master/Code-Wars-Repo/CodeWars_Environment/DescendingOrder.cs"> DescendingOrder </a>
|     Heading      |   Details  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|   Difficulty | 7 kyu  | 
| Instructions | Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as a argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number. |
| Examples | Input: 21445 Output: 54421<br />  Input: 145263 Output: 654321<br />  Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321 |

|     Heading      |   Details  |
| ------------- | ------------- |
|   Difficulty  | 7 kyu  |
| Instructions | Welcome. In this kata, you are asked to square every digit of a number. |
| Examples | 9119 => 811181 |
|  Notes | The function accepts an integer and returns an integer |
